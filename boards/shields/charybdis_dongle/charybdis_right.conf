## PMW3610 Driver - Now using native Zephyr driver
## Native driver is configured via device tree properties in charybdis_pmw3610.dtsi
CONFIG_SPI=y
CONFIG_INPUT=y
#CONFIG_SPI_LOG_LEVEL_DBG=y

## Note: The following settings from the external driver are now configured in device tree:
## - PMW3610_SMART_ALGORITHM -> smart-mode property in DT
## - PMW3610_INVERT_X/Y -> invert-x/invert-y properties in DT
## - PMW3610_SWAP_XY -> handled via axis mapping in DT
## - REST downshift configs -> native driver uses automatic power management
