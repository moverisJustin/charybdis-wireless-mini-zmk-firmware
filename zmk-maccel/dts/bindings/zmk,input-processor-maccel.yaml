  Mouse acceleration input processor for ZMK.
  Applies velocity-based scaling to trackball input, providing
  precision for slow movements and speed for fast sweeps.

compatible: "zmk,input-processor-maccel"

properties:
  "#input-processor-cells":
    type: int
    required: true
    const: 0
    description: Number of cells in the input processor specifier (always 0 for maccel)

  track-remainders:
    type: boolean
    description: Whether to track remainders for this processor (for ZMK input system)

  slow-threshold:
    type: int
    default: 5
    description: |
      Velocity threshold (distance/ms) below which slow-factor is applied.
      Lower values make slow mode more sensitive.

  fast-threshold:
    type: int
    default: 20
    description: |
      Velocity threshold (distance/ms) above which full speed (100%) is applied.
      Values between slow and fast thresholds use med-factor.

  slow-factor:
    type: int
    default: 30
    description: |
      Multiplication factor (as percentage) for slow movements.
      30 = 30% of original movement. Lower values = more precision.

  med-factor:
    type: int
    default: 60
    description: |
      Multiplication factor (as percentage) for medium-speed movements.
      60 = 60% of original movement.
